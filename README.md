# ImageEditor
The folowing is my Image Editor application. It was coded in spring of 2021 as a part of my high school graduation paper.
## How to use
After launching the application, you will be in the Select Image window. By clicking on the Load button, you will be able to select an image you want to edit from your computer.
If the image is selected successfully, by pressing Next button the Effect type selection window will open. There you can select the Type of effect you want to apply. 
Again, after the selection click Next to proceed. Lastly, choose specific effect and press the Apply button. After the image is edited, you will see the Save button. 
By clicking on it, you'll be able to select the folder where you want to save your image, name and the format too.
